1. Use your favorite CAD program to generate your 3D model of the links
    1. Do yourself a favor and place the origin coordinate system in good places (interface, symmetrical, ...)
    2. Export a .stl file of the links
2. Import the .stl files into blender and make sure the coordinate system is exactly where you want it to be
3. Import the .stl files into meshlab
    1. You can easily unify duplicate edges, fill holes in the mesh, etc.
    2. export the model twice, one as .stl for the collision and one as .dae for the visuals
